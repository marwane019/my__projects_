What this is
A simple set of small demos I built to show what I can do with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can click, move sliders, and see results right away. No installs.

How to view
Online: open the live link above.
Local: double click index.html. Or run: python -m http.server and open http://localhost:8000

Projects (plain English + what to try)

1.CMB Spectrum
What it is: a moving curve from a small formula used in cosmology.
How to use: move the three sliders; the blue line changes.
What to notice: different settings change the shape; you can download the numbers as CSV.

2.N-Body Simulation
What it is: dots that pull each other like gravity.
How to use: change particle count and time step; toggle trails; press Restart.
What to notice: energy and FPS badges update; smaller time step is more stable.

3.Pathfinding
What it is: finds a path on a grid from start to goal.
How to use: click to draw or remove walls; choose A* or Dijkstra; press Run.
What to notice: blue squares show the path; explored cells and path length are shown.

4.JD <-> CV Matcher
What it is: compares a job description with my CV text.
How to use: paste both texts and click Analyze.
What to notice: you get a rough match percentage and a list of missing keywords.

5.Exoplanet Habitability
What it is: a toy model that estimates temperature, gravity, and a simple score.
How to use: move sliders for star mass, distance, planet size, mass, albedo, and greenhouse.
What to notice: the score goes up when temperature and gravity are close to Earth.

6.Transit Lightcurve
What it is: shows the small drop in brightness when a planet crosses a star.
How to use: change planet size and duration.
What to notice: bigger planets make deeper dips; duration makes the dip wider.

7.Procedural Dungeon
What it is: a random cave map generator using simple rules.
How to use: click Generate; adjust Fill % and Steps to change the look.
What to notice: higher Fill adds more walls; more Steps makes smoother caves.

8.NASA APOD
What it is: fetches NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day with its caption.
How to use: click Load Today.
What to notice: it uses NASA’s demo API key; if rate-limited, try again later.

9.Open-Meteo Chart
What it is: a small line chart for temperature over the next ~48 hours.
How to use: enter latitude and longitude, then click Plot.
What to notice: the line goes up and down with the forecast from the API.

10.SpaceX Next Launch
What it is: shows info about the next SpaceX launch with a live countdown.
How to use: just open the page; it loads automatically.
What to notice: mission name, planned time, notes, and a timer that updates.
